You will have to write the answers to all the questions.
The time limit is 4 hours, but I expect that 3 will be absolutely enough for most people.
In addition to the questions, there will be 15-20 wrong code snippets.
In the wrong code, you just need to find the mistake and explain why it's wrong, correct code is not required to write. 
You can write explanations in English, Italian, French, Spanish or Russian if you want. Cursive is fine, but please make it readable.
Questions requiring long explanations are worth more than those requiring a precise answer.
Questions (within python and c++ sections) will come in random order to make it harder to cheat.
You will be provided paper, but please bring your own NON red pens.
The passing number of points has not been decided yet.
