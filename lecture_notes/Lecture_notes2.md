### Functions

If you have tried to do the last lecture homework, you might have realized that retyping the same code over and over becomes unfeasible very soon. This is why we need functions.

A function is a block of code that performs some operation. It can take input parameters and it can return a value as output. If it doesn't return any value, it's return type is `void`. The simplest function you can write is:

```
void function(){};
```

This function does nothing. Let's make it do something.

```
void function(){
    std::cout<<"Hello, World!" <<std::endl;
}
```

If we need to return a value we need to specify the return type:

```
int function(){
   std::cout<<"I am a function that returns 77"<<std::endl;
   return 77;
}
```

To call a function, you do the following (inside `main`, or inside another function)

```
function();  //<---- it the return type is void
```

or 

```
int result = function();
```

If you are not sure which type the function returns or the return type is way too long (we will see such examples later), you use **auto** keyword

```
auto result = function();
```

#### Passing parameters to functions:

You function may need input parameters

```
int add_two(int a){
    return a+2;
}
```

Please note that the name of a parameter in a function definition is a "dummy", it can be whatever and if you write

```
int a;
int b = add_two(a);
```

*this is not the same a*.


What if you want to modify that parameter?

```
void add_two_ref(int& a){
    a=a+2;
}
```

This is called passing by reference.

Note that if you do

```
void add_two_ref(int a){
    a=a+2;
}
```

your variable will not get changed.

In C, you could only do:
```
void add_two_ref(int* a){
    *a=*a+2;
}
```

which was called "passing by reference", but actually it was "passing by pointer". If you pass by pointer, then you need to put the `&` in front of the variable when calling the function:

```
int z{8};
add_two(&z);
```
This is discouraged in C++ for "single variables" and can cause ambiguity and hard-to-catch bugs when you forget if it's an array or not, so avoid this unless you are using C-libraries. Arrays are already pointers and will always be passed "by pointer".

```
void print_array(int* arr, const int N){
    //accessing "normally"
    for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
        std::cout<<arr[i]<<" ";
    }
    std::cout<<std::endl;
    //accessing with "pointer arythmetics"
    for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
        std::cout<<*(arr+i)<<" ";
    }
    std::cout<<std::endl;
}


int main(){
   const int N{5};
   int arr[N];//array is a pointer!!
   print_array(arr,N); 
   for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
     arr[i]=i*i;
   }   
   print_array(arr,N); 
}

```

#### Pointers and references:

Pointers and references are a very important concept in C++ and exist on their own, without the context of functions (although they are the most important in passing parameters). 

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of whatever it points to. It needs to have a type to know how to read that memory.

```
int a{0};
int* pointer{nullptr}; //doesn't have to be initialized, but it's better to put `nullptr` when you create it.
pointer=&a; //here & means *address of the variable*
```

To get access to a, we need to **dereference** a pointer by placing a `*` before the name. We have seen this syntax in the function example already.

```
std::cout<< *pointer << std::endl;
```

A reference is defined with the `&` and *should be initialized at declaration*. **This is not the same `&` as we had when taking the address,** so things might look confusing at first. Do "play around" with example files to understand what's going on.

```
int a{0};
int& b{a};
```
Now `b` becomes an alias for a. You do with `b` whatever you wanted to do with `a`. If you run the following, you will see that the addresses and values of the variable and a reference to it are equal.

```
    int a{77};
    int& c{a};//c becomes an alias for a
    std::cout<<"a is: "<<a<<std::endl;
    std::cout<<"c is: "<<c<<std::endl;
    std::cout<<"address of a is: "<<&a<<std::endl;
    std::cout<<"address of c is: "<<&c<<std::endl;
```

#### Function overloading

You can have different functions with the same name if they have a different number of type of the input parameters.

```
void add_two(int&a){
    a=a+2;
}

void add_two(int&a, int&b){
    a=a+2;
    b=b+2;
}

void add_two(double& a){
    a=a+2;
}

```

#### Recursive functions:

Functions can call themselves, in that case they are called *recursive functions*. 

```
unsigned long long int factorial(int N){
    if(N==1){
        return 1;
    }else{
        return N*factorial(N-1);
    }
}
```

Recursive functions are slower than iterations, but are sometimes much easier to write, so you need to know how to work with them.


#### Class member functions

Classes can have *member functions* that act on member variables. They have access to all member variables, including private ones, you do not need to pass anything.

One of the special member functions that doesn't have a return type at all is *constructor*. Constructors exist to initialize class member variables. Default constructor takes no parameters (if you don't want it to exist, you can use `CCoords() = delete;`).

```
class CCoords{
    double x;
    double y;
public:
    //default constructor
    CCoords(){
      x=0;y=0;  
    }
    //constructor with a parameter
    //a different syntax with the initializer list
    //it's "just a syntax" here, but can be important when member variable is also of some class type
    //pay attention to the initialization order!
    CCoords(double x1, double y1):x(x1),y(y1){
    }
    //only need the declaration here
    void print();
    //try to implement them yourself!
    auto getx();//this is c++14 standard
    auto gety();
    void setx(double a);
    void sety(double a);
};
```

If defining all the functions inside a class makes it too long (anything longer then "one screen" is too long), you can take the definition outside the class with the following syntax.

```
void CCoords::print() {
    std::cout<<x<<" "<<y<<std::endl;
}
```


### Test yourself:
 - What is a reference?
 - What is a difference between passing variables to functions by reference and by value?
 - Why do we want to pass variables to functions by reference rather than by pointer?
 - If the function accepts pointers (signature `int function(int* a)`), how do you pass a variable defined as `int x` to it?
 - Why do we want to use `const` modifier whenever possible?
 - If you have a pointer named `p`, how do you access a value it points to? What is the name of that process?
 - What value is stored in the pointer variable itself?
 - What can you say about a function that has signature `void function()`?
 - What is an `auto` keyword?
 - What is function overloading?
 - What is a recursive function?
 - What is the role of a constructor in a class?
 - How can we change private member variables of a class?

### Exercises:

#### Exercise 0:
Read the lecture notes and run all the examples mentioned in them. If you have little experience, it's better if you re-type rather than copy. Seeing that pointers/references are important, today it's a pretty useful exercise, don't skip it.


#### Exercise 1:
(prerequisite: exercise 1 of Lecture 1)
Add a contructor to your class of coefficients to initialize them all to zero. Add a class member function that prints the coefficients. Add a class member function that asks the user to input the coefficients. Write a function that takes a variable of your coefficient class as input and solves the equation (this function should also print solutions). You `main` function should be similar to

```
CCoeffs coeffs;
coeffs.ask_for_input();
coeffs.print();
solve_quadratic_equation(coeffs);

```


#### Exercise 2:
(prerequisite: exercise 1 of Lecture 2)
Create a class called "CQuadratic_Equation". It should have a class member variable of a type CCoeffs and two member variables of the other class "complex" (that you need to also create; if you already feel comfortable with c++, you can use the std::complex instead) to store solutions. Add a class member function that solves the equation. Add a separate member function that prints solutions. Your main should be similar to

```
CQuadratic_Equation eq;
eq.coeffs.ask_for_input();
eq.coeffs.print();
eq.solve();
eq.print_solution();

```

#### Exercise 3:

Write a recursive function to print an array.
