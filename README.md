### some info:
 - exam dates are not yet set, but Winter Session is probably in February
 - exam format is probably written (with questions similar/identical to "test yourself" sections and code snippets similar to homework)
 - contact information (email, zoom and unofficial discord) are in Moodle (access from units, sissa or ict emails)
 - video recordings probably on moodle as well
 - exercise discussions will be at the last part of every lecture
 - **homework will not be checked, but you absolutely have to do it if you hope to learn anything**
 - questions through email/discord are welcome, but might take time to answer, try to ask them at breaks/exercise sessions (help each other through discord is also encouraged, I will moderate the discussion to make sure nothing wrong is being said)
